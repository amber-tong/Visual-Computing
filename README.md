# Visual-Computing
This project focuses on image processing and 2D geometry. The project implements functions for filtering images using convolutions, for transforming 2D coordinates, for warping images according to 2D transforms, for generating and manipulating Bezier curves, and for rendering implicitly defined geometry.
